# CWL, Common-Workflow-Language
- CWL is a workflow tool to make organism onboarding pipeline easier to handle as an I/O pipeline
- We aim to design some functional blocks, and concatenate them to make a complete working pipeline
- A single block in CWL language is composed of at least one **<.cwl>** files, and some blocks with a **<.yml>** file

=============================================================================
- **demo_workflow directory**: see how the connecting block work. Every block inside the folder is a copy from the same level directtory.
- **block_sample**: the basic starting structure of building block. I copy from block_sample if I develope a new block.
- **storage directory**: It is a recycle bin.
