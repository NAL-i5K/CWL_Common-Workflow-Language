# Common-Workflow-Language-CWL-
CWL is a workflow tool to make organism onboarding pipeline easier to handle as an I/O pipeline
We aim to design some functional blocks, and concatenate them to make a complete working pipeline
A single block in CWL language is composed of two files, that is, <.cwl> file + <.yml> file

=============================================================================
production directory: the code which is okay to be used in the pipeline.
block directory: the code still under development
